## Type Conversion Console App

- Type conversion is the act of the compiler converting one type to another
- In some cases we may see data loss
- This will show up in the 'Problems' tab
- We can cast to fix the problem
- Use the try catch (try and auto complete) to handle exceptions
- Keep in mind the reason we are casting is explicitly acknowledging there may be data loss

- We can also use conversions to handle cases where we cannot cast
